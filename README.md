### TNOCreator-Web
*PLANNED TNO customized showcase generator..? By a total frontend noob(

Current Dev Progress: **Adding Components**

- [ ] Arranging Elements.. Basically Just a static website

- [x] Add sidebar on right side for data customization

- [x] Add clicking sfx

- [ ] Add load preset [from local db or custom config upload&download]

 ->maybe auto crawl from tno wiki?

- [x] Add button hover gfx (maybe not? we are not refactoring hoi4 anyways lmao)

- [ ] Drag Resize desc width..?

- [ ] Add screenshot and save

- [ ] Add superevent music

- [ ] Multilingual support (well technically only the "leader of " and "Economy" string is not editable so pretty lame...)

 Add hover text menu(? maybe not since this is a showcase not refactoring hoi4!!1!)

- [x] Auto set top priority on window click

- [x] Translatable and componentized panel widgets for customization

Well but if you insist to [preview](https://hittygubby.github.io/TNOCreator-Web/) ... 

btw I really HATE separating HTML with CSS, just bringing out so much inconvenience (especially for simple sites like this one)

... so if any of you guys want to refactor due to this, fork and dont send PR...

(technically i can just spam it to random free chatbot... but simply wait for main part to complete first..?)
